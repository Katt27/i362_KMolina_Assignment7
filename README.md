# Movie Rating Analysis with Normalization and Standardization

This project analyzes movie ratings from multiple users using **Pandas** and **scikit-learn**. The goal is to explore how different users rate movies, normalize these ratings to a common scale, and standardize them for further analysis.

## Overview

In this notebook, we:

1. Load movie ratings from users into a **Pandas DataFrame**.
2. Calculate the **average rating per user** and **per movie**.
3. **Normalize the ratings** (scale from 0 to 1).
4. **Standardize the ratings** (mean = 0, std = 1).
5. Compare the results of normalization and standardization.
6. Provide a **conclusion** on when each method is more appropriate.
